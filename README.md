# AI-Powered Health Chatbot for Efficient Patient Scheduling and Resource Management

This repository contains an AI-driven health chatbot developed to streamline patient scheduling and optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities. The chatbot leverages pre-trained models and resources from Hugging Face, adapted and customized to address specific requirements of healthcare management.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Appointment Scheduling:** Utilizes AI to efficiently schedule patient appointments based on availability and priority.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Robust NLP capabilities to understand and respond to patient queries.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously improves performance through adaptive learning mechanisms.
- **Resource Management Integration:** Integrates with healthcare systems to manage resources in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for both patients and healthcare providers.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models and any custom-trained models.
- `scripts/`: Data preprocessing and other utility scripts.
- `health_chatbot.py`: Main script to run the chatbot.
